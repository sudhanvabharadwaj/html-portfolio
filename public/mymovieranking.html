<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>Hands down one of the greatest movies of all time! I'm a huge fan of the story and the performances just made me a bigger fan.</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>A beautiful story. A visual treat for a science nerd like me and the top notch music made it even more intense.</p>
<h3>Kantara</h3>
<p>A brilliant story with equal doses of humor, action and thrill. The performances were next level which takes it to the next level.</p>
